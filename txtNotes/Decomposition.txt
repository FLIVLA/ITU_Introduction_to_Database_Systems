Decomposing a relation, also known as table decomposition or splitting a table, 
refers to the process of breaking down a single table into multiple 
tables in a relational database. This is done as part of the normalization 
process to eliminate redundancy and address data dependency issues.

The decomposition process involves identifying functional dependencies 
within the original table and creating new tables based on those dependencies. 
Each new table represents a separate entity or concept within the database schema.

The main reasons for decomposing a relation are:

    --Eliminating redundancy: 
    Redundancy occurs when the same data is repeated 
    in multiple rows or columns of a table. By decomposing 
    a relation, you can create separate tables for each distinct 
    entity or concept, reducing redundancy and improving data storage efficiency.

    --Addressing data dependency issues: 
    Data dependency refers to the relationships 
    between attributes or columns within a table. Uncontrolled 
    dependencies can lead to anomalies, such as update, insertion, 
    and deletion anomalies. Decomposing a relation allows you 
    to identify and separate attributes with different dependencies, 
    resulting in more robust and maintainable database design.

    --Improving data integrity and query performance: 
    Decomposing a relation according to the principles 
    of normalization helps ensure data integrity and consistency. 
    It enables more efficient querying and retrieval of data, 
    as related information is stored in separate tables and 
    can be accessed through appropriate relationships.

During the decomposition process, you need to identify the primary key(s) of the original 
table and determine the functional dependencies between the attributes. 
By creating new tables based on these dependencies, you establish 
appropriate relationships using primary and foreign keys.

It's important to note that decomposition should be done carefully, 
considering the specific requirements and constraints of the database 
system and the nature of the data being stored. Over-decomposition or 
excessive splitting of tables can lead to increased complexity, reduced 
performance, and potential issues with data retrieval and maintenance. 
Striking the right balance between normalization and practicality is essential.
